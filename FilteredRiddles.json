One of them, Mr. Brown, told a lie. The 1st golfer said 'The 2nd Golfer is Mr. Black.' The 2nd golfer said 'I am not Mr. Blue!' The 3rd golfer said 'Mr. White? That's the 4th golfer.' And the 4th golfer remained silent. Which one of the golfers is Mr. Blue?",
    "answer": "The 3rd one",

The third golfer’s statement indicates the fourth golfer isn’t Mr. White, and since the fourth golfer says nothing, he must be Mr. Blue.",
